						## Pre-industrial era

						* Transition period between medieval and modern eras
							- Transition between past and modernity
						* New architectonic styles
							- Renaissance
							- Baroque

						<div class="bg-caption">Still from TV Series Medicci, masters of Florence depicting the construction of the dome of Florence's Cathedral</div>

						Note:

						The **Renaissance began in Florence, Italy, in the 14th century**. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici; and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centers were northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, and finally Rome during the Renaissance Papacy.

						it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

						During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tirol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.[23]

						Jules Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.[24]

						<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#000" -->
						<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.8" -->



						## New social structure

						* Aristocracy overcomes nobility
							- Wealth is power
							- Spend money in art (patrons)
						* Artists:
							- Asked to perfect and finish existing elements of the City
							- Highly skilled specialists
							- Independent from medieval corporations
							- Tied to their clients (patrons) by mutual trust
							- Untied to a particular city -> global artists

						## Architect

						* Anticipate the final result of the constructed work
						* Logic order in the architonic project
							- Proportion
							- Measure
							- Phisical properties
						- Each building part (column, arch, door, window...) has an archetypical form.
							- Architecture as an ensamblage
						- Composition's theory
							- Architecture becomes a liberal art
							- independent from painting and sculpture
						- Perspective

						## Florence

						* Birth of Renaissance
						- Wealthy families (bankers, traders)
						* Closer to roman art and architecture than that of contemporary medieval cities
							* Gothic architecture (originated in France) is seldom used in Italy
							* Cities have plenty of roman ruins

						<div class="bg-caption">Florence</div>


						Note:

						Gothic architecture was originated in France.

						===

						* Not many new cities or profound transformations
							- Cities are too big and populated
							- No need for new urban nucleous
						* Some exceptions
							- Military purposes
							- Authocratic decisions

						* Karlsruhe(Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach)

						<div class="bg-caption">Aerial image of Karlsruhe Palace and the "fan city" (Carsten Naber, CC BY-SA)</div>

						Note:
						According to legend, the name Karlsruhe, which translates as "Charles’ repose", was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave Charles III William of Baden-Durlach, woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace to find peace from his wife.

						**Believe it or not, we have seen almost all the most important features of cities in this period of time. We may stop here ;)**

						===

						* Urbanism limited to extension or refurbishment of existing urban areas
							- New fortifications
							- New public spaces connected by Streets
							- Restructiration of the city
								- opening of new main (and commercial) streets
							- Creation of new residential areas
						- Based on three elements

						### Streets

						Main streets are an invention of renaissance.

						* Features:
							- Straight and wide: considered as an architectonic object
						* Used for:
							- Accessing buildings
							- Connecting commercial routes
							- Improve communication between the diferent areas of the city -> carriages

						* **Uses:**
							- layout for new residential neighbourhoods aggregated to existing urban areas
							- layout for new cities (seldom used)
							- combination with a new network of hierarchical streets

						<div class="bg-caption">The Roman grid plan for Florence was re-established (restored) during the Renaissance and after by city governments.</div>

						Note:

						Note the straight, intersecting streets of the old city. The square in the center was the site of the former Roman forum.

						Note:

						* Planned by James Craigh in 1768, after a competition.
							- after overcrowding inside the Old Town city walls reached breaking point and to prevent an exodus of wealthy citizens from the city to London
						* built in stages between 1767 and around 1850, and retains much of its original neo-classical and Georgian period architecture.
						* UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995

							- Pedestrian only-> traffic diversion
						- Residential spaces
							- Recreation purposes
							- Local scale
							- Pedestrian only

						Note:

						Several names for the same feature: Some authors prefer to speak about _Spatial recincts_ (squares, piazzas, places, plazas...)

						Note:

						Transposition of new classical principles into cities + reaction against black death and concerns about a healthier and ordered environment.

						Perspective was used by Giotto, Fra Angelico and Masaccio (and there are even more basic proto-perspective in ancient Greece -Plato wrote about it), they were made inctuitiveley and, thus, were not accurate. Brunellesci demonstrates the perspective's mathematical principles.

						The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "Man is the measure of all things." This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.

						Note:

						* First planned ideal city
						* ideal city named after Francesco Sforza, then Duke of Milan.
						* designed by Renaissance architect Antonio di Pietro Averlino (c. 1400 - c. 1469)
						* Layout:
							- 8 point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant.
							- This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat.

							- cause: overcrowding conditions
						- Limitation of 30,000 inhabitants
						- Communications
						- services
						- sanitation

						An Ideal City (1488 - 1489)

						Plague outbreak inspired da Vinci to plan an advanced "ideal city" with communications, services, and sanitation -- not actually acheived until modern times

						## Fortifications

						<div class="bg-caption">Turin</div>

						Note:

						Walls start to be a problem for the cities because of two issues.

						<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.6" -->

						Outdated defenses due to cannon's perfection

						- Before:
							- vertical walls + ditch = impregnable cities
							- new walls could be added to protect new neighbourhood
							- only vertical direction mattered

						- Now:
							- need for bigger horizontal distance between city's perimeter walls
							- walls + complex fortifications (baluards)
							- difficult and very costly to expand

						Note:

						- Changes logics of defensive walls:

						Defensive walls constrict city growth

						- Cities can only grow in height
							- Densification and overcrowding
							- Problems with sanitation

						Note:

						Exception: England.

						* More stable context -> their kept their walls, though
						* Predecessor of new towns

						Note:

						* Granted its city rights in 1300 (the only town in Het Gooi with these rights)
						* later developed into a fortified garrison town with a textile industry.
						* The actual fortification was built by the Spanish Empire in 1572 by the King Phillip II of Spain.
						* Naarden is an example of a star fort, complete with fortified walls and a moat. The moat and walls have been restored.
