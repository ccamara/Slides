						The Renaissance is a period in European history, covering the span between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is an extension of the Middle Ages, and is bridged by the Age of Enlightenment to modern history. For some scholars marking the beginning of the modern age.

						Renaissance: ressurrect. Ressurrection of the interest for the classical culture (Greece, Rome), art, forms...

						<div class="bg-caption">View of Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance (Steve Hersey, CC BY-SA)</div>

						Note:

						The **Renaissance began in Florence, Italy, in the 14th century**. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici; and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centers were northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, and finally Rome during the Renaissance Papacy.

						it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

						During the Renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. Artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tirol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.[23]

						Jules Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.[24]

						* Florence:
						* Wealthy families (bankers, traders)
						* Closer to roman art and architecture than that of contemporary medieval cities
							* Gothic architecture (originated in France) is seldom used in Italy
							* Cities have plenty of roman ruins
						-

						Note:

						Gothic architecture was originated in France.

						## Cities in the Renaissance

						<div class="bg-caption">View of Florence, birthplace of the Renaissance (Steve Hersey, CC BY-SA)</div>

						===

						* Not many new cities or profound transformations
							- Cities are too big and populated
							- No need for new urban nucleous
						* Some exceptions
							- Military purposes
							- Authocratic decisions

						---

						<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#000" -->
						<!-- .slide: data-background-opacity="0.8" -->

						### Military purposes

						* Palma Nova
						* Neuf-Brisach

						<div class="bg-caption">An aerial photograph of Neuf-Brisach showing the layout of the town and the way it was built as a fortification (Luftfahrer, CC BY-SA)</div>

						* Karlsruhe(Charles III William, Margrave of Baden-Durlach)

						<div class="bg-caption">Aerial image of Karlsruhe Palace and the "fan city" (Carsten Naber, CC BY-SA)</div>

						Note:

						Ask students:

						According to legend, the name Karlsruhe, which translates as "Charles’ repose", was given to the new city after a hunting trip when Margrave Charles III William of Baden-Durlach, woke from a dream in which he dreamt of founding his new city. A variation of this story claims that he built the new palace to find peace from his wife.

						* Is there something remarkable about that picture?

						**Believe it or not, we have seen almost all the most important features of cities in this period of time. We may stop here ;)**

						===

						* Urbanism limited to extension or refurbishment of existing urban areas
							- New fortifications
							- New public spaces connected by Streets
							- Restructiration of the city
								- opening of new main (and commercial) streets
							- Creation of new residential areas
						- Based on three elements

						===

						<!-- .slide: id="Streets" -->

						### Streets

						Main streets are an invention of renaissance.

						* Features:
							- Straight and wide: considered as an architectonic object
						* Used for:
							- Accessing buildings
							- Connecting commercial routes
							- Improve communication between the diferent areas of the city -> carriages

						* **Uses:**
							- layout for new residential neighbourhoods aggregated to existing urban areas
							- layout for new cities (seldom used)
							- combination with a new network of hierarchical streets

						<div class="bg-caption">The Roman grid plan for Florence was re-established (restored) during the Renaissance and after by city governments.</div>

						Note:

						Note the straight, intersecting streets of the old city. The square in the center was the site of the former Roman forum.

						* built in stages between 1767 and around 1850, and retains much of its original neo-classical and Georgian period architecture.
						* UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995

							- Pedestrian only-> traffic diversion
						- Residential spaces
							- Recreation purposes
							- Local scale
							- Pedestrian only

						Note:

						Several names for the same feature: Some authors prefer to speak about _Spatial recincts_ (squares, piazzas, places, plazas...)

						Monumentality and uniformity purposes, importance of green areas for leisure.

						## Perspective

						<div class="bg-caption">The ideal city (1475), attributed to Piero della Francesca.</a>

						Note:

						Perspective was used by Giotto, Fra Angelico and Masaccio (and there are even more basic proto-perspective in ancient Greece -Plato wrote about it), they were made inctuitiveley and, thus, were not accurate. Brunellesci demonstrates the perspective's mathematical principles.

						The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the concept of Roman Humanitas and the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "Man is the measure of all things." This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.
