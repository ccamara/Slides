					## Learning outcomes

					* **From caves to cities**: Learn what conditions gave birth to the city.
					* Know the name and morphology about some ancient cities
					* Identify salient features of the ancient cities
					* Recognize the differences between settlements and cities
					* Be aware about the relationship between cities and societies

					Note:

					## Caves

					Caves where first human shelter during Paleolithic.
					**First human fossils in caves** were found in several caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane (South Africa) that conform the [Craddle of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Humankind) **dating back between 3 milion years and 1 milion years from present time**.

					Caves were used as:

					* Temporary shelter (not considered settlements)
					* Ritual places: they were not inhabitted. Humans periodically returned to them.

					Note:

					* Ask students if they know some caves like those.
				  * Altamira caves are famous because of their paintings, they were not inhabitted.

			    <p>A necropolis (plural necropoleis) is a large, designed cemetery with elaborate tomb monuments. The name stems from the Ancient Greek νεκρόπολις nekropolis, literally meaning "city of the dead".</p>

				  The Tumulus of Bougon were constructed at various times during a period of over 1200 years from 4700 to 3500 BC. It is the ancient in France.

					Other examples of Necropoleis are:

				  * `Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6al-Saflieni_Hypogeum>`_: Neolithic necropolis in Malta (c.4000 BC - c. 2500 BC).
				  * `Giza pyramid complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex>`_: in Egypt (c. 2560 – c. 2540 BC).
				  * `Naqsh-e Rustam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rustam>`_: located about 12 km northwest of Persepolis, in Fars Province, Iran. Naqsh-e Rustam is the necropolis of the Achaemenid dynasty (c. 550–330 BC)

					## First cities

					The transition from villages to cities began 6.000 years ago and took centuries, even millenia:

					>  "By the time the city comes plainly into view, it is already old: the new institutions of civilization have firmly shaped it"

					Lewis Mumford, 1989. P. 55

					Note:

					First cities: Ur, Nippur, Uruk, Thebes, Heliopolis, Assur, Niveneth, Babylon...

					What happened in those thousands of years?

					Note:

					* Ask students if they have any guess on what may have happened.
					* Let's see a timeline that will help us to answer that question.

				<h2>Some thoughts about it</h2>

					<section data-markdown data-separator="---" data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						<textarea data-template>

						* Paleolithic covers 95% of human technological prehistory and history.
						* Cities appear on neolithic era
							- **Humans have only lived in cities for 5% of their history** (and just a few of them)

						Note:

						    Note that until 2020 most of human population worldwide has lived outside cities (in contriside, villages...), which is about to change. -> Cities are an exception/outlier in humankind's history.

						---

						* Agriculture transforms how humans live and organize themselves:

						  * Food needs time to be produced (season) and can be stored
						  * Food can be stored without spoiling
						  * There is a need for continuous taking care of the plants (mostly done by women)
						  * Natality and life expectation increased -> more population
						  * Free time for hunters (men)

						---

						* **Agriculture revolution**: social and proto-urban transformation

						  * From nomadic to sedentary
						  * Rise of new social classes non-related to everyday work but with power: Protectors, Religious leaders...

						<textarea data-template>

						Clusters of few families (6-12) sharing customs, gods, languages, lifestye, space and social structure.

						---

						* Social structure was permanent without alteration in generations.

							* Villages evidence of first segregation of functions (based on gender):

								* Men: hunter, warrior
								* Women: reproduction, care
