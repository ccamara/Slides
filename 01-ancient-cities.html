					## Caves

					Caves where first human shelter during Paleolithic.
					**First human fossils in caves** were found in several caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane (South Africa) that conform the [Craddle of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Humankind) **dating back between 3 milion years and 1 milion years from present time**.

					Caves were used as:

					* Temporary shelter (not considered settlements)
					* Ritual places: they were not inhabitted. Humans periodically returned to them.

					Note:

						* Ask students if they know some caves like those.
					  * Altamira caves are famous because of their paintings, they were not inhabitted.
					  * The next evolution of the cave was the following slide

			    <p>A necropolis (plural necropoleis) is a large, designed cemetery with elaborate tomb monuments. The name stems from the Ancient Greek νεκρόπολις nekropolis, literally meaning "city of the dead".</p>

					  The Tumulus of Bougon were constructed at various times during a period of over 1200 years from 4700 to 3500 BC. It is the ancient in France.

						Other examples of Necropoleis are:

					  * `Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6al-Saflieni_Hypogeum>`_: Neolithic necropolis in Malta (c.4000 BC - c. 2500 BC).
					  * `Giza pyramid complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex>`_: in Egypt (c. 2560 – c. 2540 BC).
					  * `Naqsh-e Rustam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rustam>`_: located about 12 km northwest of Persepolis, in Fars Province, Iran. Naqsh-e Rustam is the necropolis of the Achaemenid dynasty (c. 550–330 BC)

					## First Settlements

					## First cities

					The transition from villages to cities began 6.000 years ago and took centuries, even millenia:

					>  "By the time the city comes plainly into view, it is already old: the new institutions of civilization have firmly shaped it"

					Lewis Mumford, 1989. P. 55

					Note:

					First cities: Ur, Nippur, Uruk, Thebes, Heliopolis, Assur, Niveneth, Babylon...

					What happened in those thousands of years?

					Note:

					* Ask students if they have any guess on what may have happened.
					* Let's see a timeline that will help us to answer that question.

					Some important dates from a European biased perspective.

					Pay attention to the colours/scale at the bottom of the timeline:

						* Paleolithic: Green

						* Neolithic:
						* Bronze Age

					## Some thoughts about it

					----

					* Paleolithic covers 95% of human technological prehistory and history.
					* Cities appear on neolithic era
						- **Humans have only lived in cities for 5% of their history** (and just a few of them)

					Note:

						Note that until 2020 most of human population worldwide has lived outside cities (in contriside, villages...), which is about to change. -> Cities are an exception/outlier in humankind's history.

					----

					* **Agriculture** transforms how humans live and organize themselves:

						* Food needs time to be produced (season) and can be stored
						* Food can be stored without spoiling
						* There is a need for continuous taking care of the plants (mostly done by women)
						* Natality and life expectation increased -> more population
						* Free time for hunters (men)

					----

					* **Agriculture revolution**: social and proto-urban transformation

						* From nomadic to sedentary
						* Rise of new social classes non-related to everyday work but with power: Protectors, Religious leaders...

					## Hamlets

					Clusters of few families (6-12) sharing customs, gods, languages, lifestye, space and social structure.

							<ul>
								<li>Social structure was permanent without alteration in generations.
								</li>
								<ul><li>Villages evidence of first segregation of functions (based on gender)</li>

					Note:

					  Agriculture provided an homogeneous food supply and surplus production.

					  * Need to stay long in the same place: crops take time to breed.
					  * Need to store (and protect) surplus production

						**Morphological features:**

					  Morphology is the direct result of covering their basic needs:

					  * **Dwelling**: Shelters made of wood
					  * **Food production**: Clearance for agriculture and for domestic animals (pig, dog...)
					  * **Food/Goods Storage**: Byre, Cistern (water), Granary (cereals), Storage pit (Goods like tools)...

					  Most of these new features are managed by women -> Lewis Mumford calls it a "sexual revolution" (1989, p. 11-12)

					  Features managed by women, with only exception may be the fences -> Protection -> Men

					## Cities

					<div class="bg-caption">Palmira (Mesopotamia). Photo: Bernard Gagnon</div>

					----

					> "Mark down how much the city owes technically to the village: out of it came, directly or by elaboration, the granary, the bank, the arsenal, the library, the store. Remember, too, that the irrigation ditch, the canal, the reservoir, the moat, the aqueduct, the drain, the sewer are also containers, for automatic transport or storage. The first of these was invented long before the city; and without this whole range of inventions the ancient city could not have taken the form it finally did; for it was nothing less than a container of containers."


					--Mumford, 1989. p. 16

					<!-- .slide: id="Ur"-->

					## Ur (𒋀𒀕𒆠 in Sumer)

					<div class='multiCol'>
			        <div class='col'>

							* Important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located near the mouth of the Eufrates, in current Irak. It was once a coastal city.
							* One of the oldest sumer cities (c. 3,800 BC)
							* The city's patron deity was Nanna, moon god
							* Populated: several tens of thousands inhabitants (~20,000)
							* Considerable size: 100 ha. (1km²) (Benevolo, p. 23)

			        </div>
			        <div class='col'>
			            ![](img/ancient-cities/benevolo-p24-Ur-city-map.png)
			        </div>
			    </div>










					Note:

					  Compare size with Jaca: -> I find it hard to believe that it was so small in area. -> more density than Jaca?

					  * Inhabitants: 	13,396
					  * Area: 40,634 ha
