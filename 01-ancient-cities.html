					## Caves

					Caves where first human shelter during Paleolithic.
					**First human fossils in caves** were found in several caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane (South Africa) that conform the [Craddle of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Humankind) **dating back between 3 milion years and 1 milion years from present time**.

					Caves were used as:

					* Temporary shelter (not considered settlements)
					* Ritual places: they were not inhabitted. Humans periodically returned to them.

					Note:

					* Ask students if they know some caves like those.
				  * Altamira caves are famous because of their paintings, they were not inhabitted.

					<h2>Necropoleis</h2>

			    <p>A necropolis (plural necropoleis) is a large, designed cemetery with elaborate tomb monuments. The name stems from the Ancient Greek νεκρόπολις nekropolis, literally meaning "city of the dead".</p>

			    <p>Dead were the first to have a permanent dwelling:</p>

				  The Tumulus of Bougon were constructed at various times during a period of over 1200 years from 4700 to 3500 BC. It is the ancient in France.

					Other examples of Necropoleis are:

				  * `Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%A6al-Saflieni_Hypogeum>`_: Neolithic necropolis in Malta (c.4000 BC - c. 2500 BC).
				  * `Giza pyramid complex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex>`_: in Egypt (c. 2560 – c. 2540 BC).
				  * `Naqsh-e Rustam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rustam>`_: located about 12 km northwest of Persepolis, in Fars Province, Iran. Naqsh-e Rustam is the necropolis of the Achaemenid dynasty (c. 550–330 BC)

					## First cities

					The transition from villages to cities began 6.000 years ago and took centuries, even millenia:

					>  "By the time the city comes plainly into view, it is already old: the new institutions of civilization have firmly shaped it"

					Lewis Mumford, 1989. P. 55

					Note:

					First cities: Ur, Nippur, Uruk, Thebes, Heliopolis, Assur, Niveneth, Babylon...

					What happened in those thousands of years?

					Note:

					* Ask students if they have any guess on what may have happened.
					* Let's see a timeline that will help us to answer that question.
